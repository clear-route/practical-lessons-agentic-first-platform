# Final Workshop Report V3

This document provides a synthesized overview of the research findings, tailored for the 'Practical lessons from building an agentic-first developer platform' workshop.

## Demystifying the agentic journey

**Core Idea:** This section should focus on the initial steps and challenges of adopting agentic AI. It should provide a clear path for enterprises to start their journey, from understanding the basic concepts to achieving initial buy-in from stakeholders. Key topics include defining the agentic journey, identifying the first tangible use cases, and building a foundation for future growth.

## Strategizing for measurable wins

**Core Idea:** This section should provide a practical guide to planning and executing a successful agentic AI proof-of-concept. It should emphasize a low-risk, value-driven approach that focuses on clear, measurable outcomes. Key topics include selecting the right use case for a PoC, defining success metrics, and building a business case for further investment.

### Key Insights

The article **Xenonstack Ai Agents Devops** provides valuable insights into the **Strategizing for measurable wins**.                     It highlights the importance of **practical, low-risk, proof-of-concept, poc, quantifiable outcomes, measurable wins, roi**.                     Key takeaways include:
- Starting with a clear business problem is crucial for success.
- A well-defined PoC with measurable outcomes is essential for gaining enterprise buy-in.
- Building a rich toolkit of AI/agent primitives is a key enabler for future autonomy.

## Laying the groundwork for future autonomy

**Core Idea:** This section should focus on the long-term vision of building an autonomous enterprise platform. It should discuss the strategic building blocks that need to be in place to support future autonomy, including a robust toolkit, a flexible workflow engine, and a scalable architecture. Key topics include the evolution from simple agents to a multi-agent system, the importance of a common platform, and the role of data in driving autonomous decisions.

## AI/Agent Primitives

**Core Idea:** This section should provide a detailed explanation of AI/agent primitives and their role in building agentic systems. It should differentiate between deterministic and non-deterministic workflows and explain how a rich toolkit of primitives can enable the creation of complex and sophisticated agents. Key topics include the definition of agent primitives, examples of common primitives, and the relationship between primitives, workflows, and the overall agent architecture.
