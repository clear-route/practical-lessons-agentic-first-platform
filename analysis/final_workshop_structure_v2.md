# Final Workshop Structure V2

This document provides a structured outline for the 'Practical lessons from building an agentic-first developer platform' workshop, based on the research and synthesis conducted.

## Workshop Introduction

- **Hook:** Start with a compelling story about a real-world problem that was solved with an agentic platform. For example, the story of how a major telecommunications company used IaC to streamline their network rollout, as mentioned in the XenonStack article.
- **Agenda:** Briefly outline the three main sections of the workshop.
- **'Through Threads':** Introduce the three 'through threads' that will be woven throughout the presentation.

### Start Small and Targeted

The research consistently emphasizes the importance of starting with small, well-defined use cases that can deliver tangible value quickly. This approach helps to build momentum and gain enterprise buy-in for more ambitious agentic AI initiatives.

### The Power of Primitives

A recurring theme is the importance of building a rich toolkit of AI/agent primitives. These primitives serve as the building blocks for more complex and sophisticated workflows, and are essential for the long-term success of any agentic platform.

### Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic

The research highlights the need to balance deterministic and non-deterministic workflows. While non-deterministic workflows, powered by LLMs, can provide more flexibility and creativity, deterministic workflows are essential for ensuring reliability and predictability in enterprise use cases.

## Demystifying the agentic journey

**High-Level Point:** This section should focus on the initial steps and challenges of adopting agentic AI. It should provide a clear path for enterprises to start their journey, from understanding the basic concepts to achieving initial buy-in from stakeholders. Key topics include defining the agentic journey, identifying the first tangible use cases, and building a foundation for future growth.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Key Theme:** The agentic journey is an iterative process that requires a cultural shift towards automation and data-driven decision-making. As the GitLab article points out, AI in DevOps is not a one-time setup, but a continuous evolution.
- **Common Challenge:** Gaining enterprise buy-in is a major hurdle. Overcoming fear of the unknown and demonstrating tangible value early on is crucial. The XenonStack article highlights 'unclear ROI from PoCs' as a primary challenge, which underscores this point.
- **Successful Pattern:** Start with a 'co-pilot' or a simple automation agent that addresses a specific pain point. This helps to build trust and demonstrate the potential of agentic AI. The MyKubert article provides a good example of this with their 'Kubert Assistant'.
- **Emerging Best Practice:** Treat agentic AI as a product, not a project. This means having a dedicated team, a clear roadmap, and a focus on continuous improvement. This is a recurring theme in several of the articles, including the one from Microsoft Research.

## Strategizing for measurable wins

**High-Level Point:** This section should provide a practical guide to planning and executing a successful agentic AI proof-of-concept. It should emphasize a low-risk, value-driven approach that focuses on clear, measurable outcomes. Key topics include selecting the right use case for a PoC, defining success metrics, and building a business case for further investment.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Key Theme:** The importance of a value-driven approach, focusing on clear, measurable outcomes. The XenonStack article provides a case study of a telecom provider that achieved faster deployments and reduced errors by implementing an IaC solution.
- **Common Challenge:** Unclear ROI and difficulty in moving from a successful PoC to a production-ready solution. This is a recurring theme in the XenonStack article.
- **Successful Pattern:** Choose a use case with a clear and measurable outcome, define success metrics upfront, and involve stakeholders from the beginning.
- **Emerging Best Practice:** Use value-stream mapping to identify high-impact use cases that can deliver a quick and measurable ROI. This is a key takeaway from the DevOps Handbook, which is referenced in the MyKubert article.

## Laying the groundwork for future autonomy

**High-Level Point:** This section should focus on the long-term vision of building an autonomous enterprise platform. It should discuss the strategic building blocks that need to be in place to support future autonomy, including a robust toolkit, a flexible workflow engine, and a scalable architecture. Key topics include the evolution from simple agents to a multi-agent system, the importance of a common platform, and the role of data in driving autonomous decisions.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Key Theme:** The need for a platform-based approach to ensure consistency, scalability, and reusability of agentic solutions. The XenonStack article emphasizes this point, and the MyKubert article provides a practical example of a platform-based approach.
- **Common Challenge:** Scaling the platform and managing the complexity of a multi-agent system. The GitLab article touches upon this challenge and suggests that a platform-based approach is essential for managing this complexity.
- **Successful Pattern:** Build a common platform with a rich toolkit of reusable primitives. This allows teams to build new agents quickly and consistently. The Microsoft Research article provides a great example of this with their 'Agent Primitives' concept.
- **Emerging Best Practice:** Use a 'golden path' approach to guide developers in building new agents. This ensures that all agents adhere to the same standards and best practices. This is a key concept from the DevOps Handbook, and is a great way to ensure consistency and scalability.

## AI/Agent Primitives

**High-Level Point:** This section should provide a detailed explanation of AI/agent primitives and their role in building agentic systems. It should differentiate between deterministic and non-deterministic workflows and explain how a rich toolkit of primitives can enable the creation of complex and sophisticated agents. Key topics include the definition of agent primitives, examples of common primitives, and the relationship between primitives, workflows, and the overall agent architecture.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Key Theme:** The importance of a rich toolkit of AI/agent primitives as the building blocks for more complex and sophisticated workflows. The Microsoft Research article provides a great deep-dive on this topic.
- **Common Challenge:** Designing the right set of primitives, ensuring their reliability, and managing the complexity of the toolkit. The XenonStack article touches upon the challenge of 'tool overload' in traditional DevOps, which can be exacerbated in an agentic world.
- **Successful Pattern:** Start with a small set of well-defined primitives and expand the toolkit over time. This allows for a more agile and iterative approach to building the agentic platform.
- **Emerging Best Practice:** Treat primitives as first-class citizens of the platform, with their own documentation, tests, and versioning. This ensures that they are reliable, reusable, and easy to maintain. This is a key takeaway from the Microsoft Research article.
