# Knowledge Gaps in Agentic Platform Discourse

This document outlines key knowledge gaps identified in the current thought leadership space regarding agentic platforms. These are areas where information is scarce, contradictory, or particularly complex, and represent opportunities for you to establish yourself as a thought leader in your workshop.

## The 'Messy Middle' of Agentic Adoption

While there's a lot of content about the 'first step' (PoCs) and the 'end state' (fully autonomous platforms), there's a lack of practical guidance on how to navigate the messy middle. This includes:

- **Scaling from a successful PoC to a wider rollout:** How do you take a successful PoC and apply it to other teams and use cases? What are the common challenges and pitfalls to avoid? For example, the XenonStack article mentions the challenge of moving PoCs into production, but it doesn't provide a detailed roadmap for how to do so.
- **Managing the increasing complexity of a multi-agent system:** As the number of agents grows, so does the complexity of the system. How do you manage this complexity and ensure that the agents are working together effectively? The articles from MyKubert and GitLab touch on this, but they don't provide a detailed framework for multi-agent orchestration.
- **Evolving the platform over time:** An agentic platform is not a one-and-done project. It needs to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the business. How do you design a platform that is flexible and extensible enough to support this evolution? This is a key area where your practical lessons can shine.

## The Role of the Human-in-the-Loop

Many articles mention the importance of human oversight, but there's little practical advice on how to design and implement effective human-in-the-loop workflows. This includes a lack of discussion on:

- **The user experience of interacting with agents:** How do you design interfaces that allow for effective collaboration and intervention? What are the best practices for presenting information to the user and for allowing them to provide feedback and guidance to the agent? The UiPath article provides some high-level ideas, but there's a need for more concrete examples.
- **The different levels of human involvement:** Not all tasks require the same level of human involvement. How do you design a system that can gracefully degrade from fully autonomous to fully manual, depending on the context and the user's preferences? This is a key design consideration that is often overlooked.
- **The role of the human in handling exceptions and edge cases:** No agent is perfect. How do you design a system that can effectively handle exceptions and edge cases, and that can learn from its mistakes over time? This is another area where your practical experience will be invaluable.

## Measuring the ROI of Agentic Platforms

While everyone agrees that measuring ROI is important, there's a lack of consensus on *how* to do it. The metrics are often vague (e.g., 'increased efficiency') and there's a need for a more standardized approach to measuring the impact of agentic AI. This includes:

- **Defining a clear set of metrics:** What are the key metrics that you should be tracking to measure the success of your agentic platform? How do you attribute the value created by the platform to the specific agents and workflows that are running on it? The XenonStack article provides a list of challenges in adopting AI, including 'unclear ROI from PoCs', which highlights the need for a solution here.
- **Building a business case for further investment:** How do you use the data you've collected to build a compelling business case for further investment in the platform? How do you communicate the value of the platform to stakeholders who may not be familiar with the technology?

## The Ethics of Agentic AI in DevOps

The ethical implications of using AI to automate software development and deployment are not widely discussed. This includes:

- **The potential for bias in AI-driven decisions:** How do you ensure that your agents are making fair and unbiased decisions? What are the potential sources of bias in your data and your models, and how can you mitigate them?
- **The impact on the role of the developer:** How will the role of the developer change in an agentic-first world? Will they become 'agent wranglers' or 'prompt engineers'? What are the new skills that developers will need to succeed in this new environment?
- **The need for new governance and accountability frameworks:** Who is responsible when an agent makes a mistake? How do you ensure that your agents are being used in a responsible and ethical manner? What are the new governance and accountability frameworks that are needed to support the widespread adoption of agentic AI?
