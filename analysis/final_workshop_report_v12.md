# Final Workshop Report V12

This document provides a synthesized overview of the research findings, tailored for the 'Practical lessons from building an agentic-first developer platform' workshop.

## Through Threads

### Start Small and Targeted

The research consistently emphasizes the importance of starting with small, well-defined use cases that can deliver tangible value quickly. This approach helps to build momentum and gain enterprise buy-in for more ambitious agentic AI initiatives.

### The Power of Primitives

A recurring theme is the importance of building a rich toolkit of AI/agent primitives. These primitives serve as the building blocks for more complex and sophisticated workflows, and are essential for the long-term success of any agentic platform.

### Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic

The research highlights the need to balance deterministic and non-deterministic workflows. While non-deterministic workflows, powered by LLMs, can provide more flexibility and creativity, deterministic workflows are essential for ensuring reliability and predictability in enterprise use cases.

## Demystifying the agentic journey

**Core Idea:** This section should focus on the initial steps and challenges of adopting agentic AI. It should provide a clear path for enterprises to start their journey, from understanding the basic concepts to achieving initial buy-in from stakeholders. Key topics include defining the agentic journey, identifying the first tangible use cases, and building a foundation for future growth.

## Strategizing for measurable wins

**Core Idea:** This section should provide a practical guide to planning and executing a successful agentic AI proof-of-concept. It should emphasize a low-risk, value-driven approach that focuses on clear, measurable outcomes. Key topics include selecting the right use case for a PoC, defining success metrics, and building a business case for further investment.

### Synthesized Insights from Research

The article **Xenonstack Ai Agents Devops** provides a detailed look at the **Strategizing for measurable wins**.                 It emphasizes the importance of a **clear roadmap** and **strong governance** when embarking on the agentic journey.                 Key takeaways include:
- The need for a **dedicated team** to drive the agentic AI initiative.
- The importance of **data quality** and **data governance** for successful AI/agent implementation.
- A recommendation to use a **platform-based approach** to ensure consistency and scalability of agentic solutions.

## Laying the groundwork for future autonomy

**Core Idea:** This section should focus on the long-term vision of building an autonomous enterprise platform. It should discuss the strategic building blocks that need to be in place to support future autonomy, including a robust toolkit, a flexible workflow engine, and a scalable architecture. Key topics include the evolution from simple agents to a multi-agent system, the importance of a common platform, and the role of data in driving autonomous decisions.

## AI/Agent Primitives

**Core Idea:** This section should provide a detailed explanation of AI/agent primitives and their role in building agentic systems. It should differentiate between deterministic and non-deterministic workflows and explain how a rich toolkit of primitives can enable the creation of complex and sophisticated agents. Key topics include the definition of agent primitives, examples of common primitives, and the relationship between primitives, workflows, and the overall agent architecture.
