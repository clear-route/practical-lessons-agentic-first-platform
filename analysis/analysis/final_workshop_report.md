# Final Workshop Report

This report provides a synthesized and structured overview of the research findings, tailored for the 'Practical lessons from building an agentic-first developer platform' workshop.

## Demystifying the agentic journey

**Summary:** This section should focus on the initial steps and challenges of adopting agentic AI. It should provide a clear path for enterprises to start their journey, from understanding the basic concepts to achieving initial buy-in from stakeholders. Key topics include defining the agentic journey, identifying the first tangible use cases, and building a foundation for future growth.

## Strategizing for measurable wins

**Summary:** This section should provide a practical guide to planning and executing a successful agentic AI proof-of-concept. It should emphasize a low-risk, value-driven approach that focuses on clear, measurable outcomes. Key topics include selecting the right use case for a PoC, defining success metrics, and building a business case for further investment.

## Laying the groundwork for future autonomy

**Summary:** This section should focus on the long-term vision of building an autonomous enterprise platform. It should discuss the strategic building blocks that need to be in place to support future autonomy, including a robust toolkit, a flexible workflow engine, and a scalable architecture. Key topics include the evolution from simple agents to a multi-agent system, the importance of a common platform, and the role of data in driving autonomous decisions.

## AI/Agent Primitives

**Summary:** This section should provide a detailed explanation of AI/agent primitives and their role in building agentic systems. It should differentiate between deterministic and non-deterministic workflows and explain how a rich toolkit of primitives can enable the creation of complex and sophisticated agents. Key topics include the definition of agent primitives, examples of common primitives, and the relationship between primitives, workflows, and the overall agent architecture.

## Suggested Diagrams and Visual Aids

- **The Agentic Journey:** A flowchart illustrating the transition from manual processes to a fully agentic platform, highlighting key milestones and decision points.
- **The Agentic-First Platform:** A high-level architecture diagram showing the core components of an agentic-first platform, including the agent toolkit, workflow engine, and user interface.
- **Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Workflows:** A side-by-side comparison of the two workflow types, with examples of each.
- **The 'Golden Path' for Agentic Workflows:** A visual representation of a 'golden path' for a specific use case, such as a CI/CD pipeline or an incident response process.
