[{"text":"Title: What Are AI Agents? | IBM\nDescription: These agents, unlike simple reflex agents, can store information in memory and can operate in environments that are partially observable and changing. However, they are still limited by their set of rules.6 · Example: A robot vacuum cleaner. As it cleans a dirty room, it senses obstacles such ...\nURL: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents\n\nTitle: What are AI agents? Definition, examples, and types | Google Cloud\nDescription: Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.\nURL: https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents\n\nTitle: Agents in AI - GeeksforGeeks\nDescription: Some AI agents can learn from past ... allows agents to refine their behavior over time. For example, a recommendation system on a streaming platform learns users' preferences and suggests content accordingly....\nURL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/agents-artificial-intelligence/\n\nTitle: What Are AI Agents? Definition, examples, and types\nDescription: It optimizes its actions toward predefined goals such as deflection, co-pilot, etc. Though Agent AI seeks data to generate contextually relevant answers, it still respects data partitioning rules, such as region-specific regulations or team-based visibility constraints (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2).\nURL: https://devrev.ai/blog/ai-agents\n\nTitle: Primitive — The Science of Machine Learning & AI\nDescription: A primitive is the smallest unit of processing available to a programmer of a particular machine, or can be an atomic element of an expression in a language.\nURL: https://www.ml-science.com/primitive\n\nTitle: What are AI Agents?- Agents in Artificial Intelligence Explained - AWS\nDescription: They make rational decisions based on their perceptions and data to produce optimal performance and results. An AI agent senses its environment with physical or software interfaces. For example, a robotic agent collects sensor data, and a chatbot uses customer queries as input.\nURL: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/\n\nTitle: AI Agents vs Agentic AI: What’s the Difference and Why Does It Matter? | by Edwin Lisowski | Medium\nDescription: Explore the difference between AI Agents and Agentic AI, and their real-world applications across industries.\nURL: https://medium.com/@elisowski/ai-agents-vs-agentic-ai-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter-03159ee8c2b4\n\nTitle: What are AI agents? How they work and how to use them\nDescription: Since the form of an AI agent depends so much on the tasks it carries out, you may find that some AI agents have all these components and others don't. For example, a smart thermostat may lack learning components, only having basic sensors, actuators, and a simple control system.\nURL: https://zapier.com/blog/ai-agent/\n\nTitle: Types of AI Agents | IBM\nDescription: There are 5 main types of AI agents: simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents and learning agents. Each type has distinct strengths and applications, ranging from basic automated systems to highly adaptable AI models.\nURL: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent-types\n\nTitle: 36 Real-World Examples of AI Agents\nDescription: AI agents for hotels can streamline room services, suggest nearby amenities, upsell hotel services, and help staff coordinate needs. ... Unlike simpler agents that might merely react to environmental stimuli, utility-based agents evaluate their potential actions based on the expected utility.\nURL: https://botpress.com/blog/real-world-applications-of-ai-agents","type":"text"}]
